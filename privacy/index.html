Privacy Policy for Sobriety Timer
Last Updated: June 6, 2025
Sobriety Timer ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Sobriety Timer mobile application ("App"). Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.
1. Information We Collect
We may collect the following types of information when you use the App:
a. Personal Information

Sobriety Start Date: You may voluntarily provide your sobriety start date to track your progress. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless you choose to back up your data (see Data Backup below).
User-Provided Information: If you contact us directly (e.g., via email for support), you may provide personal information such as your name or email address.

b. Non-Personal Information

Usage Data: We may collect anonymized data about how you use the App, such as frequency of use, features accessed, or crash reports. This data does not identify you personally and is used to improve the App's performance and user experience.
Device Information: We may collect information about your device, such as device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers, to ensure compatibility and optimize performance.

c. Data Backup (Optional)

If you enable cloud backup (e.g., via Google Drive integration), your sobriety start date and related progress data may be stored on third-party servers. This feature is optional, and you must explicitly opt in to use it. We do not access or control this data; it is managed by the third-party service provider under their privacy policies.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:

Track and display your sobriety progress within the App.
Provide customer support if you contact us.
Analyze anonymized usage data to improve the App’s functionality and user experience.
Ensure the App operates correctly and is compatible with your device.

3. How We Share Your Information
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:

Service Providers: We may share anonymized data with third-party service providers (e.g., analytics providers) to help us understand App usage and improve performance. These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and cannot use the data for other purposes.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or subpoena, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.
Business Transfers: If Sobriety Timer is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you before this happens and provide you with options regarding your data.

4. Data Storage and Security

Local Storage: Your sobriety start date and progress data are stored locally on your device by default. You are responsible for securing your device.
Cloud Backup: If you opt into cloud backup, your data is stored securely on third-party servers (e.g., Google Drive). We use industry-standard encryption to protect data in transit.
Security Measures: We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

5. Your Choices and Rights

Access and Control: You can view, edit, or delete your sobriety data directly within the App. If you use cloud backup, you can manage your data through the third-party service provider’s interface.
Opt-Out: You can opt out of cloud backup at any time, and your data will remain on your device. You can also uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data.
Data Portability: You may export your sobriety data (e.g., as a text file) if the App provides this feature.
Regional Rights: Depending on your location (e.g., under GDPR for EU residents or CCPA for California residents), you may have additional rights, such as the right to access, delete, or restrict processing of your data. Contact us at support@sobrietytimer.com to exercise these rights.

6. Third-Party Services
The App may integrate with third-party services (e.g., Google Drive for backups or analytics tools). These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We are not responsible for the practices of these third parties.
7. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us immediately at support@sobrietytimer.com, and we will take steps to delete it.
8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the updated policy in the App or via email (if provided). Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
